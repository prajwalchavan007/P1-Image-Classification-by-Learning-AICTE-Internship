# P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship

I have done this project to classify images by using CNN model and pre traned mobile Net model . I create the streamlit model app for the same .

## How to run the code 

I used the anaconda promt to create the project environment and install required pakages for  this project. Also there are creation of streamlit app also developed with the help of python .


## Acknoledgement 

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have supported me throughout the completion of my internship project on the Implementation of a Machine Learning Model for Image Classification.
First and foremost, I would like to thank Abdul Aziz Md, my internship supervisor, for their invaluable guidance, encouragement, and insightful feedback throughout the project. Their expertise and constant support have been crucial in helping me overcome challenges and gain a deeper understanding of machine learning and image classification.
I also extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire team at Edunet Foundation, who provided a stimulating and collaborative environment. Their assistance and input helped me to better comprehend the practical applications of machine learning techniques and to enhance the quality of my work.
Thank you all for your unwavering support.
