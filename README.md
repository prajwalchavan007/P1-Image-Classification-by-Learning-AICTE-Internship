# Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship

I have done this project to classify images by using CNN model and pre traned mobile Net model . I create the streamlit model app for the same .

## How to run the code 

I used the anaconda promt to create the project environment and install required pakages for  this project. Also there are creation of streamlit app also developed with the help of python .

##Feature

Data collection  
Data preprocessing
Data filtration
Model implementation
Model evaluation

## Acknoledgement 

Streamlit 
Tensorflow

## Getting strated

Prerequisites

-Python 3-7
-Any web browser

Software Requirements:

To implement the image classification model, the following software tools and technologies are required:

·  Programming Languages:
Python: Python is the primary language used for developing machine learning and deep learning models. It provides robust libraries and frameworks for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
 
·  Libraries/Frameworks:
TensorFlow/Keras: These are the primary libraries for implementing deep learning models, especially CNNs. Keras (which is part of TensorFlow) provides a high-level API for building and training neural networks efficiently.

1. NumPy:
A Python library for numerical computations, essential for handling data arrays and performing matrix operations.

2. Matplotlib/Seaborn:
These libraries are used for plotting and visualizing the results of model performance, including accuracy curves, loss curves, and confusion matrices.

·  Integrated Dvelopment Environment (IDE):

·  Jupyter Notebook: An interactive development environment ideal for prototyping, experimenting, and visualizing results during the development of machine learning models.
PyCharm/VSCode: Full-featured IDEs for Python development, providing a more robust environment for coding, debugging, and project management.
